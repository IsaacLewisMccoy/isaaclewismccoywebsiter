			A-342 is a large bipedal humanoid creature found near Gusau Nigeria. People in Gusau have named it Iyipada. The creature stands at 7.4ft tall. A-342 looks similar to a human, apart from its distinct black fur with stripes and creature also has elongated arms that reach down to their knees, the creature’s head is what personal noticed first. The head is capable of changing, sightings before capture have described heads of animals like monkeys, goats, and even some animals outside of Africa like a cockatoo and bear. In its confinement, these heads have been reported. But researchers are not sure if it is capable of other shifts. Reports of A-342 date back to mid 1600’s implying it is an ancient animal. If not species

		<p>
			Overall A-342 is a very violent creature and is to be kept in high security at all times. A-342 is not capable of speech and any form of speech to them is responded with deathly screams and violent outbursts. Researchers are unsure as to why these outbursts happen.  But further research will be conducted

		<h2>Transcript of capture</h2>
		<h3>The following conversation is with Dr. ████ and Squad 6A Commander John ████</h3>
	  <p></p>
		<p>Dr. ████: thank you for meeting with me today. I know what’s going on right now makes you quite [long pause] busy.</p>
	  <p>John ████: It’s alright, I’d rather take a break from all that. Now what did you want me to describe?</p>
		<p>Dr. ████: I’ve come to learn that your team is responsible for capturing AF-342, are there any.. Behaviours that we should take into account when researching?</p>
	  <p>John ████: Too many [pause] That freaks not a fuckin’ pushover. For one, don’t talk to that thing, no fucking clue why. But the moment █████ tried to speak to it. it just started running. Tore the poor man in half [blesses himself] [long pause] Second thing.. It might be obvious now, don’t get near it. Its arms are longer. you’d expect so keep at least a 5 meter distance at all times. Uuuhhh [pause] Last thing.. Hit it’s head, no clue why but it hates it when you hit its head. So if you wanna discipline him or just take out some anger. Hit him on the head as hard as you can. Y’know, for me.</p>
	  <p>Dr. ████: thank you John. This information should prove to be very useful in our research, especially your discussion on the head. We’ll focus on that. [long pause] I’ll also tell you if we hit him. I’ll be sure to try it.</p>
		<p>John ████: [chuckles]. Thank you Doc.. Need anything else?</p>
	  <p>Dr. ████: No, that’s all. Go enjoy the rest of your day</p>
		<p>John ████: Thanks Doc. I’ll try.</p>
