			<h3>All of this information comes directly from Jaquin before he died</h3>
			<p>AS-001 (Better known as Comus) doesn’t have a single defined form. Initially being found by Jaoquin Perez in Chile as an eel, he spoke to Jaoquin as means to get away. Saying “Who are you”. Later Jaoquin returned home to spread what he had just witnessed, The people in his town had not believed him. All but one, a man named Comus. This man spoke calmly to Jaoquin. Asking small questions about the location time and manner of the encounter.</p>
			<p>After some time Jaoquin figured out Comus and the Eel were one person. Jaoquin had confronted the Man and he confirmed. Comus stated that he had come down from the skies to find someone capable of leading. And Jaoquin was this man. Five years later in the year 1423, Comus and Jaoquin spotted another anomaly, tracking it. And keeping it in an area for safety and observation</p>
			<p>Comus and Jaoquin created what can be considered a business. Which later turned into the World Safety Project. After Jaoquin witnessed one of these anomalies kill a person, seemingly without reason. Jaoquin devoted his life to capturing these Creatures, and researching ways to keep his fellow humans safe. Which Comus seemed incredibly happy to help</p>
			<p>Turns out that every single anomaly and creature are connected. Every single creature is related to an animal that is native to its area. And these creatures have internal deformities that are all related. Their heart is on the opposite side of the body. And each creatures blood is a distinct colour, different to the standard red. After Jaoquin had found the anomalies with similar deformities. He pierced a weapon through Comus’ right thigh. He bled bright pink blood.</p>
			<p>Jaoquin tried to push Comus out of the organisation, as he was scared of what Comus intended to do with his own species. But he couldn’t, Comus had gotten what he wanted. And showed Jaoquin his reasoning. Comus called in one of the Creatures they had captured. Comus pierced it with his fingernail and the creature fell, turning into a black liquid similar to tar. Jaoquin looked back up to see Comus taking the shape of the animal.</p>
			<p>Comus stated “I will use these animals, I will take over, I will become this worlds god”. “why” Jaoquin responded. “Hate” Comus replied “I have been alive for millennia, all these filthy beings see me as is prey. All they want me to be is an animal that can be used, can be killed, skinned and eaten. While the actual prey attend to each other. They don’t understand what makes something capable of complex thought and life. And humanity haven’t achieved that. I created these animals to show that, but they all failed. And you help me make the greatest one… Myself.”</p>
			<p>Jaoquin ran, for days he ran. Then found another civilisation unaffected by his own organisation. Writing a transcript of his life, and what Comus is capable of. Although it fell to deaf ears.</p>
			<p>Comus is capable of shifting into seemingly any form he needs, and his original form is unknown. He is insanely dangerous but cannot be kept in any form of holding cell if it was possible to capture him. People who learn of this information go missing roughly a week after reading.</p>
